# Examples
## IO
In this example you can see how to use the IOs.
The input is declared inside IRUINO as I0, I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7; the output is declared as O0, O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, O6, O7.
## display
In order to use the display in the default mode you have only to include the `Display.h` header file.
The default mode for the display displays:
- in the first line the inputs state;
- in second line the name of the product ("IRUINO");
- in the third line the analogical input value;
- in the fourth line the outputs state.
